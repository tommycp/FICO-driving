# FICO-driving
Data science minor capstone project for Tommy White, Alex Braksator, and Owais Sarfaraz at Cal Poly, SLO in 2018.

This project is being completed with supervision from [FORGOT HIS NAME] of FICO.

Data for this project is being sourced from Insight's SHRP2 NDS datasets. The data consists of sensor recordings, video screenshots, and all other information provided by a blackbox unit of a car. For each trip taken in the car, we have metrics about every action taken in the trip and we have indicators both for whether or not a "crash" occurred and when a "crash" occurred. A "crash" in this dataset ranges from running into the curb to totalling one's car.
